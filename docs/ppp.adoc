*Liu Wei Jie Nicholas* -- Project Portfolio for Optix

## About the project
My team is a group of 4 Computer Engineering Students. My team and I were tasked to  enhance a basic command line
interface(CLI) desktop Duke application while retaining the CLI feature for our Software Engineering Project.
We agreed on morphing it into a seat booking cum finance managing system for a venue such as a theatre. Our product,
Optix, allows users like theatre managers to track seat booking of a show as well as the finances from the bookings.

A snapshot of our product is as shown:
