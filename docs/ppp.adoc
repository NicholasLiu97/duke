*Liu Wei Jie Nicholas* -- Project Portfolio for Optix

## About the project
My team is a group of 4 Computer Engineering Students. My team and I were tasked to  enhance a basic command line
interface(CLI) desktop Duke application while retaining the CLI feature for our Software Engineering Project.
We agreed on morphing it into a seat booking cum finance managing system for a venue such as a theatre. Our product,
Optix, allows users like theatre managers to track seat booking of a show as well as the finances from the bookings.

A snapshot of our product is as shown:

My role was to implement the code for the commands dealing with the `finance` features. The following sections
further elaborate on my enhancements as well as on my contributions to the user and developer guide.

The following symbols are used in this document: +
`view-profit` Grey highlighted components indicate that this is a command that can be entered into
the command line of Optix.

## Summary of contributions
This sections summarizes my coding, documentation and other contributions made to the team's progress.

### Enhancements added
. Command to view the profit earned from a single show and from a particular month.

.. What it does: The `view-profit` command allows the user to view the profit earned from selling the seats
of one show. The `view-monthly` command allows the user to view monthly profits.

.. Justification: The primary goal of businesses is to generate profit. The managers would want to view the
profits earned from the shows so that they can calculate the returns from their business. Viewing the profits
of the shows would also give the users like managers an idea of how popular this particular show is, and adopt
policies to further increase their profits. For example, knowing that a particular show is constantly sold out,
theatre managers can screen more of that show on other dates to raise the revenue earned. Knowing the profits
earned every month would also allow the business to evaluate their current business strategy and make relevant
improvements. Viewing the monthly profits would also allow the business to calculate the revenue earned from all
shows in that month instead of adding the revenue from individual shows one by one.

.. Highlights: This enhancement affects commands to be added in future, such as viewing profits for multiple
shows or dates at once. The implementation was also challenging as much analysis and consideration need to be
made to decide on the most appropriate date structure to retrieve the particular show from the list. This is
crucial as other features also depend on this data structure which would affect the efficiency of the program.

. Command to re-assign the seats of customers.

.. Justification: Customers may have booked the wrong seat or mistakes might be made by the managing personnel
when booking the seats. The `re-assign` command would also allow customers to upgrade or downgrade their seat
since the prices of seats are based on the different tiers.

.. Highlights: This enhancement goes hand-in-hand with other features and commands to be added in future. Refunding
seats would require certain methods implemented by `re-assign` command. In addition, re-assign also implments certain
features of other finance commands as the cost difference between the changed seats have to be accounted for.

### Other contributions:
* Project management:
** There were a total of 3 releases, from version mid v1.1 to v1.3 as of current date. I managed releases versions
1.2 and 1.3 (2 releases) on GitHub.
** I was also in charge of ensuring that weekly increments were delivered on time.
*Enhancements to existing features:
** Wrote test cases to increase test coverage. (PR to be added)
* Documentation:
** Implemented the layout of the User Guide and Developer Guide on github.
** Added further explanations to existing features for further clarification. (Done on google docs)
** Made cosmetic improvements to the User Guide to make it more user-friendly.
* Community:
** Reviewed Pull Requests:
** Offered suggestions to team members to refactor some parts of the code for tidier
implementation.
